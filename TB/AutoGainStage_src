// Provide Automatic Gainstaging for e.g. Nebula Audio VST
// 
// by TBProAudio 2015 (www.tb-software.com)

// Usage:
// 0. Place AutoGainStage_src before plugins you want to gainstage and AutoGainStage_cntrl after 
// 1. Setup Drive Reference Level, e.g. -18 for most Nebula custom programs (0dBVU = -18dBfs)
// 2. Set Drive Control to "Analyse" in order to determine necessary gain to reach reference 
//    level and then let the DAW play ...
// 3. Set Drive Control to "Drive" in order to "drive" the following plugins with measured add. gain, 
//    the add. gain will be compensated in the control plugin// Changelog
// see AutoGain Control
